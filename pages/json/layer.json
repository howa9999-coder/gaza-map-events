It borders Egypt to the southwest and Israel to the north and east. Measuring about 365 square kilometers, it is home to over two million people, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the world.\n\nHistorically, the Gaza Strip has been a focal point of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, it came under Egyptian control until 1967, when Israel occupied it during the Six-Day War. Since 2005, Israel has disengaged from the territory, but it maintains strict control over its borders, significantly affecting the region's economy and daily life.\n\nThe Strip faces numerous challenges, including high unemployment rates, limited access to clean water, and inadequate healthcare facilities. Political tensions, frequent military conflicts, and restrictions on movement contribute to the humanitarian crisis, leading to calls for international assistance and resolution efforts.",
